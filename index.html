                <p>Hello, my name is Philip Wood and I'm from London, Ontario. I'm currently in my first year of Interactive Media Design at Fanshawe college. I was very excited to start the program, and learn how to code. So far, JavaScript has peaked my curiousity and I want to learn as much as I can about it!</p>

            <div class="textSwap">
                <p>The journey has proved to be quite difficult, but so far I'm managing. There have been many sleepless nights, where they only thing that kept me going was nicotine and caffeine.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="textSwap">
                <p>I want to continue learning more about JavaScript, and this summer I have a few projects I'd like to tackle. These projects being Blackjack and Roulette coded in Javascript. I'm excited to take on these challenges during my summer break.</p>
